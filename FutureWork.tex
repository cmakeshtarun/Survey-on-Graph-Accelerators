\section{Conclusion and Future Work}

The primary challenge in graph analytics systems has been handling the disparity between communication and computation requirements. Further performance improvements have to come from redesigning the memory subsystems as the processing capability has hit a wall. The advent of new memory technology has opened up a new design space that can advance the existing computing systems. The architectures discussed above were proposed in the last three years, after in-memory processing became feasible.

Other survey in Graph Analytics accelerators are\cite{BGA-book, SG-MT}, containing hardware or software stack focused perspective of the topic.
