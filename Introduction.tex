Graph algorithms are an interesting class of application for which a single mac mini desktop equipped with SSD outperforms a medium sized cluster! \cite{GraphChi} The primary reason for such a counter-intuitive behavior can be attributed to the irregular data-access pattern inherent in those algorithms. They also have a low computation to communication ratio which is exacerbated in the modern memory-bandwidth limited systems. However, graph algorithms are highly iterative and there is abundance of parallelism that can be exploited. These idiosyncrasies of graph algorithm render commercial HPC systems inefficient or unsuitable for accelerating such applications. Extensive research on graph processing in the past decade have revealed new insights on the algorithmic, programming model and hardware aspects of such systems. I have tried to comprehend the relevant and significant contributions of previous work in the following section.
