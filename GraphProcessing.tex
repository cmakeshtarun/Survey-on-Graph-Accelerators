\section{Graph Processing}

Bring out the importance of Graph processing from \cite{BrainGraph,RoadGraph, SocialGraph} and discuss state-of-the-art systems. Take the example of SSSP application and discuss how the Implementation changes with various models.


  \subsection{Programming model}
    Discuss the Vertex-based \cite{Pregel} and Gather-Apply-Scatter\cite{PowerGraph} based programming models here. Highlight the differences and bring out the suitability of each of them for PIM operations. Also show the pseudo code for SSSP application.

  \subsection{Execution Model}
    Two different paradigms: Synchronous vs Asynchronous\cite{Tesseract}, Ordered vs Unordered\cite{OvsUO}
